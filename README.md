The objective of this project was to develop an AI-powered software for event photos, allowing photographers to upload event pictures , the system would employ AI algorithms to segregate low-quality photographs based on criteria such as blurriness, duplication, and closed eyes.
Photo Segregation: Utilizing AI algorithms, the system identifies and segregates low-quality photos based on the following criteria:
i.	Blurriness: Implement an algorithm to detect blurry images and separate them from the clear, high-quality photos.
ii.	Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate images to maintain a clean and organized photo collection.
iii.	Closed Eyes: Utilize facial recognition and eye detection to identify photos where subjects have closed eyes and flag them for review.
iv.	Best face angle detection: Task that aims to find the optimal angle of a face in an image 
v.	Head Tilt Detection:  To measure the angle of the head in an image or video.
